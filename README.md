*Visual representation of climate forecasting model predictions.*

This project harnesses advanced transformer-based models to forecast global climate trends using time series data from significant sources like NOAAGlobalTemp and CO2 Emissions. Through innovative approaches in single-shot and autoregressive models, along with single-task and multi-task learning, we aim to enhance prediction accuracy and reliability, offering a new benchmark for environmental forecasting.
